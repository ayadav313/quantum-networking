Non-Locality and Entanglement
Imagine we have created a pair of entangled qubits.

Non-Locality and
Entanglement

• Even if we move one qubit to the Moon,
the global state of the two qubits cannot be
described solely in terms of the individual
state of each of them!
• In particular, if we measure one of the
qubits, this apparently instantaneously
affects the other one.

Entanglement Creation
•

To create entangled photons, we use a special type of
crystal to split one photon into an entangled pair of
photons

•

A single incoming beam (typically blue or ultraviolet)
can thus conjure up two beams (typically red)

•

This process occurs particle by particle: each blue
photon splits into two red ones

Spooky link between atoms

• A qubit transmitted from one
location to another
• Related to entanglement of
quantum systems.
• Defined as a process by which a
qubit (the basic unit of quantum
information) can be transmitted
from one location to another,
• without the qubit actually being
transmitted through space.

Teleportation
1. Two entangled qubits, forming an EPR pair, are generated
and distributed so that one qubit (particle A) is stored by
Router A and another qubit (particle B) is stored by
Router B

2. Router A performs a BSM upon the two qubits at its side,
i.e., the qubit to be transmitted and particle A

B

3. Then, Router A sends the measurement outcome, i.e., 2
classical bits, to Router B with a classical channel
4. By processing particle B according to the measurement
outcome, Router B finally obtains the qubit by applying
appropriate unitary transformation
