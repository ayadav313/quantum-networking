Alice applies a CNOT
and a Hadamard to
q and her EPR half.
She measures the bits in
the 0/1 basis and sends
the information to Bob.

Bob receives the two
bits and acts on his
side of the EPR, in
a way that recreates
the unknown qubit

What is Teleportation?
It is not like how you see it in the movies! We can teleport information, but not
matter. Specifically, we can transfer the state of one qubit to another over long
distances.
Recently, a Chinese team used a satellite to teleport a qubit 1400 kilometers,
setting the world record! Using fiber optic cables, the maximum range is around
100 kilometers because of decoherence.
Decoherence is when a qubit interacts too much with its environment and
collapses prematurely. The superposition is destroyed and information is lost.

Why is Teleportation Needed?
In classical computers, there is no such thing as teleportation. Computers can
make a copy of the data and send the copy. This is impossible in quantum
computers because of the no-cloning theorem.
It is impossible to create a copy of an arbitrary quantum state because we would
know the position and momentum of a particle which violates the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle.
To move the state of a qubit over long distances without physically transporting
it, we can teleport the original state to the target qubit.

Overview of the Teleportation Process
There are 3 qubits used in the process of teleportation:
The qubit whose state will be teleported, called the input
The qubit who will receive the state, called the output
An auxiliary qubit to help the process, called the ancilla
The ancilla and output qubits are entangled at location A and the output is sent to
the destination, location B. The teleportation can now occur any time after this.

The teleportation process is started at location A, then information is sent via a
classical channel to location B to finish the process.
Since we are sending information classically, teleportation is not faster than light.

The Teleportation Process
1) At location A, we have a single-qubit state: |Ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
where α and β are unknown. If they were known, we could just send them
classically and re-create the quantum state at the destination.
1) Entangle the ancilla with the output qubit, forming a bell state:
|ϑ⟩ = ( |00⟩ + |11⟩ )
Then send the output qubit to location B.
1) Create a tensor product between the input and entangled state:
ω1 = Ψ ⊗ ϑ = ( α|000⟩ + α|011⟩ + β|100⟩ + β|111⟩ )

4)

The two qubits in location A are sent through a CNOT gate.
ω1 = ( α|000⟩ + α|011⟩ + β|110⟩ + β|101⟩ )

5)

The input qubit is sent through a Hadamard gate.
ω2 = ½ [ |00⟩( α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ ) + |01⟩( α|1⟩ + β|0⟩ )
+ |10⟩( α|0⟩ - β|1⟩ ) + |00⟩( α|1⟩ - β|0⟩ ) ]
Using the identity matrix, I and the three Pauli matrices, X, Y, and Z:
ω2 = ½ [ |00⟩ I|Ψ⟩ + |01⟩ X|Ψ⟩ + |10⟩ Z|Ψ⟩ + |00⟩ XZ|Ψ⟩ ]

6)

Measure the input and ancilla qubits and send the result to location B via a
classical channel. Check the value and apply gates as shown

The result of the measurement in location A
returns 00, 01, 10, or 11.
This corresponds to the output qubit’s state being:
( α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ ) , ( α|1⟩ + β|0⟩ ) ,
( α|0⟩ - β|1⟩ ) , or ( α|1⟩ - β|0⟩ )
Applying the gates shown in the table will
transform the output qubit into ( α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ ).
