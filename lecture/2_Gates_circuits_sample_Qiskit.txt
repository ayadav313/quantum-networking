Quantum Computers
Gates, circuits and programming

Quantum gates

Quantum gates
• The same way
classical gates manipulate only a few bits at a time,
quantum gates manipulate only a few qubits at a time
– Usually represented as unitary matrices we already saw

• Circuit representation

…boxes and different symbols
depict operations on qubits

Wires depict qubits

…inheritence of classical computing –
it is better to think of qubits as particles
and gates as physical processes applied to those particles

Pauli-X gate
• Acts on a single qubit
Dirac notation

Matrix representation

Circuit representation

– Acting on pure states becomes a classical NOT gate

Dirac notation…
…is obviously more convenient for calculus

Pauli-X gate
– Acting on a general qubit state

– It is its own inverse

Hadamard gate
• Acts on a single qubit
– Corresponding to the Hadamard transform we already saw
Dirac notation

Unitary matrix

Circuit representation

…obviously, no classical equivalent

– One of the most important gates for quantum computing

Hadamard gate
• An interesting example

Acting on pure states…
…gives a balanced superposition…
…both states, if measured,
give either 0 or 1 with equal probability

Hadamard gate
– Applying another Hadamard gate
• to the first result

• to the second result

Hadamard gate
Both states give equal probabilities when measured…

…but when Hadamard transformation is applied
it produces two different states

• The example gives an answer to the question asked before –
why state of the system
has to be specified with complex amplitudes
and cannot be specified with probabilities only

Pauli-Y gate
• Acts on a single qubit
Dirac notation

Matrix representation

Circuit representation

…another gate with no classical equivalent

CNOT gate
• Controlled NOT gate
• Acts on two qubits
Matrix representation

– Classical gate operation

Circuit representation

CNOT gate
– Example of acting on a superposition

Toffoli gate
• Also called Controlled Controlled NOT
• Acts on three qubits
Matrix representation

– Classical gate operation

Circuit representation

Quantum circuits

Universal set of quantum gates
• There is more than one universal set of gates for classical
computing
• What about quantum computing, is there a universal set of
gates to which any quantum operation possible can be
reduced to?

Universal set of quantum gates
• No, but any unitary transformation
can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy
using a universal gate set
– For example (H, S, T, CNOT)
Hadamard gate

Phase gate

π/8 gate

CNOT gate

Quantum circuits
• The same way
classical gates can be arranged to form a classical circuit,
quantum gates can be arranged to form a quantum circuit
Unlike classical circuits,
the same number of wires
is going throughout the circuit
…as said before,
inheritence of classical computing –
usually it does not reflect the actual implementation

• Quantum circuit is the most commonly used model
to describe a quantum algorithm

Quantum programming

Quantum programming
• There is already a number of programming languages adapted for
quantum computing
– but there is no actual quantum computer for algorithms to be executed on

• The purpose of quantum programming languages is to provide a
tool for researchers, not a tool for programmers
• QCL is an example of such language

Sample code: Quantum Computing with Qiskit: Pauli X gate

QCL
Language

Quantum programming
• QCL (Quantum Computation Language)
C-like syntax
allows combining of
quantum and
classical code

http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html

QCL
• Comes with its own interpreter and quantum system simulator
Start interpreter…
…with a 4 qubit quantum heap (32 if omitted)
Numeric simulator

Shell environment
…there is no assumption about the quantum computer implementation

QCL
• Example of interpreter interactive use
Initial quantum state
Global quantum register definition

Quantum operator
Resulting state

Qubits allocated/Quantum heap total

QCL
• Example of initialization and measurement within interpreter

Reinitializations have no effect on allocations

QCL
• Examples of quantum registers, expressions and references

Reference definitions have no effect on quantum heap

QCL
• Example of operator definition

QCL
– Newly defined operator usage
Force interactive use…
…or interpreter will execute file content and exit

Toffoli gate is its own inverse
QCL allows inverse execution
