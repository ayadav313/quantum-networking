Installing Qiskit and IBMQ
Setup

Installing Anaconda

•

Link: https://www.anaconda.com/

•

After the download and installation, check if you can open
Anaconda Navigator

Creating Anaconda Environment
•

To create a new anaconda environment, we use the following code.
If on a Mac, open terminal. If on Windows, open command prompt.

•

To create a new python environment, we use the following code.
Let’s name it “quantum”. conda create -n quantum python=3

•

Since we named our environment quantum, conda activate
quantum will open the environment . If you gave another name,
make sure to type that name to open the environment.

•

Installing Qiskit
•

Qiskit is a python module, we can install it using pip. The code is as
follows:

•

For MacOS users: python -m pip install ‘qiskit[visualization]’

•

For Windows users: pip install qiskit[visualization]

•

This code automatically installs Jupyter lab on your environment. So
type jupyter notebook to open jupyter lab.

•

Additionally install: pip install rise

Creating a new IBMQ Account

•

Link : https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/

•

From the link above create your new account and login from the
same link after you create a new account.

API Token
You will be able to see an API Token after you login.

•

Now go to the jupyter lab, create a new ‘.ipynb’ le. Now copy,
paste and run the code in the next slide. Remember to replace the
API token with your own token.

Code
# Importing the 'Qiskit' Module
from qiskit import *
from qiskit import IBMQ
# paste the api code in 'apostrophes'
#you only need to save the account once, from the next time just load the account.
IBMQ.save_account('PASTE_Your_API_Toeken_Here')
IBMQ.load_account()
# Creating a Quantum circuit
circuit = QuantumCircuit(2,2)
# To view the circuit, we use the 'draw()' funcction.
circuit.draw()

Output should look like this:
