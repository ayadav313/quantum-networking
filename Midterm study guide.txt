A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, analogous to a bit in classical computing. It can be in a superposition of states, allowing for parallel computation.

Entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where two qubits can become correlated in a way that their states cannot be described independently. The state of one qubit can instantly affect the state of the other, even if they are far apart.

Teleportation is a process where the state of one qubit can be transferred to another qubit over a long distance without physically transporting the qubit itself. This requires entanglement and classical communication.

Superdense coding is a process where two classical bits of information can be transmitted using only one qubit in a maximally entangled state.

Quantum gates are the equivalent of classical logic gates, but operate on qubits instead of bits. Examples include the Hadamard gate, CNOT gate, and Pauli gates.

Quantum circuits are composed of quantum gates operating on qubits, and can perform operations such as 
superposition, entanglement, and teleportation.

Quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, are designed to take advantage of the unique properties of quantum computing to solve certain problems faster than classical algorithms.

Decoherence is a major challenge in quantum computing, where the interaction of qubits with their environment can cause them to lose coherence and collapse prematurely, leading to errors. Error correction techniques, such as quantum error correction codes, are being developed to address this issue.

Quantum computing has applications in areas such as cryptography, optimization, simulation, and machine learning. It has the potential to revolutionize many fields, but also poses new challenges and requires significant resources and expertise.
